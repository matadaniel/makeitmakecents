# makeitmakecents

Financial education content that is easy to understand.

## 💡 Motivation

[The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index](https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TIAA_GFLEC_Report_PFin_April2024_07.pdf)
assessed financial literacy among U.S. adults.
On average, only 48% of the questions were answered correctly.
In particular, 71% of Gen Z correctly answered only half or fewer of the questions.

I want to help increase financial literacy among my peers with this website.
